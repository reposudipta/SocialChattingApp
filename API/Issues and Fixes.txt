*********Problem on running angular project***********
"File C:\Users\HP\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is
 disabled on this system."

Fix- This could be due to the current user having an undefined execution policy.
run this command - Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
